# Predicting-US-commute-time
Using Big Data Analytics to predict the US commute time based on the NHTS dataset.

# Goal of the project
The objective of the project was to predict commute time based on attributes such as trip miles, purpose, miles which was unlike the traditional prediction system.
The data set is from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) https://nhts.ornl.gov. We implemented regression for the project with Python, Apache Spark and Hadoop. To predict commute time, we used Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Elastic Net Regression and Random Forest for feature selection and prediction. For optimization, we leveraged feature engineering and hyper parameter optimization techniques.
